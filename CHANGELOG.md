The upgrade process requires changing the configuration file name. Below are the recommended steps to follow:

1. Change the name of the configuration file from `/etc/nginx/aws.yaml` to `/etc/nginx/config.yaml`.
2. Download the Release 0.3 nginx-asg-sync package for your OS and upgrade the package using the OS tools (dpkg or rpm).

4. Modify the /etc/nginx/aws.yaml file:
    * Remove the `upstream_conf_endpoint` and `status_endpoint` fields.
    * Add the `api_endpoint` field. See an example in the configuration section of the README.md
5. Download the Release 0.2 nginx-asg-sync package for your OS and upgrade the package using the OS tools (dpkg or rpm).
6. Check the logs of nginx-asg-sync to make sure that it is working properly after the upgrade.
